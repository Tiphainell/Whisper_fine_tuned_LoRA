/home/tleludec/Transcription_whisper/venv_oberon/lib/python3.10/site-packages/pydantic/_internal/_generate_schema.py:2249: UnsupportedFieldAttributeWarning: The 'repr' attribute with value False was provided to the `Field()` function, which has no effect in the context it was used. 'repr' is field-specific metadata, and can only be attached to a model field using `Annotated` metadata or by assignment. This may have happened because an `Annotated` type alias using the `type` statement was used, or if the `Field()` function was attached to a single member of a union type.

Some parameters like ``normalize``, ``format``, ``buffer_size``, and ``backend`` will be ignored. We recommend that you port your code to rely directly on TorchCodec's decoder instead: https://docs.pytorch.org/torchcodec/stable/generated/torchcodec.decoders.AudioDecoder.html#torchcodec.decoders.AudioDecoder.
